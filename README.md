# DeepFreight
Codebase for my paper: DeepFreight: A Model-free Deep-reinforcement-learning-based Algorithm for Multi-transfer Freight Delivery

Language: Python

The following components are included:
- A multi-hop freight delivery simulator.
- Implementations of SOTA MARL algorithms: MAVEN, QMIX, Weighted QMIX, MSAC, COMA.
- Implementation of a MILP solver based on Gurobi, which is used in conjunction with the MARL output.
